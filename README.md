# Transformers for Natural Language Processing Practice Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains my personal coding practice based on the book "Transformers for Natural Language Processing, Second Edition" by Denis Rothman. Each chapterâ€™s code is implemented, explored, and annotated for deeper understanding.

## About the Book
"Transformers for Natural Language Processing" is a comprehensive guide to building, training, and fine-tuning deep neural network architectures for NLP tasks. It includes a bonus chapter on ChatGPT and GPT-4, with a foreword by Antonio Gulli, Engineering Director at Google.

## Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a chapter in the book and contains:
- Python code files with implementations and comments.
- Additional notes and personal insights.
- Exercises and their solutions.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Chapter-wise Practice**: Navigate to the chapter you're currently studying and find the relevant code and notes.
2. **Exercises**: After each chapter, try to solve the exercises before looking into the solutions provided.
3. **Projects**: Apply the concepts by creating mini-projects, documented in their specific directories.

## Installation and Setup
Instructions on setting up the environment to run the code examples. This includes:
- Python version
- Required libraries (`requirements.txt`)
- Setup commands
